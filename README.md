# BluVisionMicro

We have developed the BluVision image analysis Framework for studying plant-pathogen interactions on microscopic level. The system is build to study the life cycle of the important barley and wheat pathogen powdery mildew by collecting and analyzing image data from three key developmental stages.

BluVision is a software and hardware framework for high-throughput image acquisition and analysis of microscopic images in plant pathology. The microscopic module is based on a state of the art high-throughput microscope scanner (Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1).

Our image analysis pipeline is aimed to detect and analyze microscopic infection events (Figure 2 & 3).
